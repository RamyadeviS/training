 <p>&emsp;&emsp;1. COVID-19 has turned our lives upside down.
 To control the spread of the virus, the government
has imposed a lockdown in the state of Tamilnadu.</p>
<br>
 <p>&emsp;&emsp; 2. As a result, people are not allowed to step
  out of their homes unless it is necessary.</p>
  <br>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;3. Even for essential tasks like going to the 
 grocery store or the doctor, people need to 
 obtain an e-pass from the government.</p>
<br>
 <p>&emsp;&emsp;4.The Tamilnadu State government has made TN <br>E-Pass
 Registration compulsory for traveling anywhere in 
  India because of the increase in COVID-19 Fresh Cases.</p>
